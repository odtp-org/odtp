 1. Definitions.
 
       "You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity
       authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement
       with the SDSC. For legal entities, the entity making a
       Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by,
       or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a
       single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition, "control"
       means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or
       management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or
       (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding
       shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
 
       "Contribution" shall mean the code, documentation or other original
       works of authorship expressly identified in Schedule B, as well as
       any original work of authorship, including
       any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally
       submitted by You to the SDSC for inclusion in, or
       documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by the
       SDSC (the "Work"). For the purposes of this definition,
       "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written
       communication sent to the SDSC or its representatives,
       including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing
       lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems
       that are managed by, or on behalf of, the SDSC for the
       purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding
       communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated
       in writing by You as "Not a Contribution."
 
    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions
       of this Agreement, You hereby grant to the SDSC and to
       recipients of software distributed by the SDSC a perpetual,
       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
       copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of,
       publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute
       Your Contributions and such derivative works.
 
    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
       this Agreement, You hereby grant to the SDSC and to recipients
       of software distributed by the SDSC a perpetual, worldwide,
       non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as
       stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use,
       offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
       by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s)
       alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to
       which such Contribution(s) were submitted. If any entity institutes
       patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a
       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your
       Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed, constitutes
       direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
       granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or
       Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
 
    4. You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above
       license. You represent further that each employee of the
       Corporation designated on Schedule A below (or in a subsequent
       written modification to that Schedule) is authorized to submit
       Contributions on behalf of the Corporation.
 
    5. You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original
       creation (see section 7 for submissions on behalf of others).
 
    6. You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions,
       except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide
       support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by
       applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your
       Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS
       OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without
       limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
       MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
 
    7. Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation,
       You may submit it to the SDSC separately from any
       Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and
       of any license or other restriction (including, but not limited
       to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which
       you are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as
       "Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here]".
 
    8. It is your responsibility to notify the SDSC when any change
       is required to the list of designated employees authorized to submit
       Contributions on behalf of the Corporation, or to the Corporation's
       Point of Contact with the SDSC.
