# ODTP: Open Digital Twin Platform

ODTP offers a comprehensive suite of functionalities to enhance digital twins' management, operation, and analysis. In ODTP, a digital twin is an advanced virtual model, embodying a broad spectrum of scenarios and systems that mirror current conditions and forecast future scenarios, offering users a robust platform for strategic optimization and decision-making. With ODTP, the digital twin concept transcends traditional boundaries, providing a pivotal tool for various applications, ensuring adaptability, insight, and innovation across diverse domains.

## Features

- **Intuitive User Interface** to manage and operate your digital twins. 
- **Component Execution** to execute your or existing components for simulation, analysis or visualization.
- **Iteration Monitoring** to check digital twins iterations.
- **Log Analysis** to conveniently access and analyze container logs.
- **Workflow Design Tool** to design and run digital twins.
- **Schema Management & Testing** to restart and test different schemas for MongoDB / S3.
- **Result Analysis** to inspect outputs/snapshots and download results. 

## How to use it?

## Terminology

- ODTP: A tool designed to manage, run, and design digital twins. It offers an interface (CLI, and GUI) for running and managing digital twins. It wraps different open source technologies to provide a high level API for the final user. 
- Components (ODTP Term): Extensions generated by us or the community that perform specific tasks in the digital twin. The input/output is validated semantically, and they run within a docker container as an independent micro-service. They can be one of the following categories:
	- Dataloader component. 
	- Analytical component.
	- Visualization component.
- Core/core-optional modules (ODTP Term): These modules are the different parts that we are developing for the ODTP. These core modules include the different classes/methods needed to run the tool and wrap the services used. Some of these modules are not mandatory in order to run ODTP with the minimal features (i.e. running manually odtp components).
- Services: One service or micro-service, in a micro-services architecture refers to one logical unit that performs one specific task in an independent manner. In ODTP we use different servers to support core modules, such as MongoDB for the database, Minion for the storage, or GraphDB for the knowledge graph storing. But also, from a technical standpoint every component is turned into a micro-service when running. I think this is the part that’s bringing more confusion.

## Acknowledgments and Funding
This work is part of the broader project **O**pen **D**igital **T**win **P**latform of the **S**wiss **M**obility **S**ystem (ODTP-SMS) funded by Swissuniversities CHORD grant Track B - Establish Projects. ODTP-SMS project is a joint endeavour by the Center for Sustainable Future Mobility - CSFM (ETH Zürich) and the Swiss Data Science Center - SDSC (EPFL and ETH Zürich). 
The Swiss Data Science Center (SDSC) develops domain-agnostic standards and containerized components to manage digital twins. This includes the creation of the Core Platform (both back-end and front-end), Service Component Integration Templates, Component Ontology, and the Component Zoo template. 
The Center for Sustainable Future Mobility (CSFM) develops mobility services and utilizes the components produced by SDSC to deploy a mobility digital twin platform. CSFM focuses on integrating mobility services and collecting available components in the mobility zoo, thereby applying the digital twin concept in the realm of mobility.
