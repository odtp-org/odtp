EPFL / ETH Zürich / SDSC / Lausanne / CH
Software Grant and Corporate Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement")

The Swiss Data Science Center (SDSC) operates as a “Société Simple” (einfache Gesellschaft) under Swiss law, collaboratively established by EPFL (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne) and ETH Zürich (Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich). While EPFL and ETH Zurich contribute equally to the SDSC, the center is administratively housed and managed by EPFL, serving as the Management Office and Leading House.

Thank you for your interest in the Open Digital Twin Platform (ODTP) project managed by the Swiss Data Science Center (SDSC). This Agreement clarifies the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from entities (referred to herein as "the Corporation") to the SDSC. Each contributing Corporation must have a signed Contributor License Agreement (CLA) on file, indicating acceptance of the license terms outlined below.

Purpose of the Agreement:
This Agreement serves to protect both the Contributor and the SDSC, as well as SDSC users. It does not change the Corporation’s rights to use its own Contributions for any other purpose but is necessary for any Contributions to components of the Open Digital Twin Platform (ODTP) project. Under this Agreement, the Corporation is authorized to make Contributions to the SDSC, submit Contributions from its designated employees, and grant SDSC copyright and patent licenses to those Contributions.

Terms of Agreement:
By signing this Agreement, the Corporation accepts and agrees to the following terms and conditions for its present and future Contributions submitted to the SDSC. Except for the license granted herein to the SDSC and recipients of software distributed by the SDSC, the Corporation reserves all right, title, and interest in and to its Contributions. The SDSC commits to not using the Contributions in a way that is contrary to the public benefit or inconsistent with its nonprofit status and bylaws in effect at the time of the Contribution.

Software Grant and Corporate Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement")

  1. Definitions.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity
      authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement
      with the SDSC. For legal entities, the entity making a
      Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by,
      or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a
      single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition, "control"
      means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or
      management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or
      (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding
      shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "Contribution" shall mean the code, documentation or other original
      works of authorship expressly identified in Schedule B, as well as
      any original work of authorship, including
      any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally
      submitted by You to the SDSC for inclusion in, or
      documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by the
      SDSC (the "Work"). For the purposes of this definition,
      "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written
      communication sent to the SDSC or its representatives,
      including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing
      lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems
      that are managed by, or on behalf of, the SDSC for the
      purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding
      communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated
      in writing by You as "Not a Contribution."

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions
      of this Agreement, You hereby grant to the SDSC and to
      recipients of software distributed by the SDSC a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute
      Your Contributions and such derivative works.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this Agreement, You hereby grant to the SDSC and to recipients
      of software distributed by the SDSC a perpetual, worldwide,
      non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as
      stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use,
      offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s)
      alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to
      which such Contribution(s) were submitted. If any entity institutes
      patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your
      Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed, constitutes
      direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or
      Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above
      license. You represent further that each employee of the
      Corporation designated on Schedule A below (or in a subsequent
      written modification to that Schedule) is authorized to submit
      Contributions on behalf of the Corporation.

   5. You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original
      creation (see section 7 for submissions on behalf of others).

   6. You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions,
      except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide
      support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by
      applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your
      Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS
      OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without
      limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
      MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

   7. Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation,
      You may submit it to the SDSC separately from any
      Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and
      of any license or other restriction (including, but not limited
      to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which
      you are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as
      "Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here]".

   8. It is your responsibility to notify the SDSC when any change
      is required to the list of designated employees authorized to submit
      Contributions on behalf of the Corporation, or to the Corporation's
      Point of Contact with the SDSC.
